// Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands.
// The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. 
// Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
// Algorithm 
// To sort an array of size n in ascending order: 
// 1: Iterate from arr[1] to arr[n] over the array. 
// 2: Compare the current element (key) to its predecessor. 
// 3: If the key element is smaller than its predecessor, compare it to the elements before. Move the greater elements one position up to make space for the swapped element.
// Java program for implementation of Insertion Sort
