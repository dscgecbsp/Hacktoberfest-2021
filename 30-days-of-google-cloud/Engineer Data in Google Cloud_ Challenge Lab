/////////Task 1: Clean your training data///////////////////////

In the Cloud Console, navigate to Menu > BigQuery.
Click on More > Query settings under the Query Editor.
Select Set a destination table for query results under Destination; Enter taxi_training_data as the Table name
And For Destination table write preference ->Overwrite table
Click Save
Run the following SQL query

Select
  pickup_datetime,
  pickup_longitude AS pickuplon,
  pickup_latitude AS pickuplat,
  dropoff_longitude AS dropofflon,
  dropoff_latitude AS dropofflat,
  passenger_count AS passengers,
  ( tolls_amount + fare_amount ) AS fare_amount
FROM
  `taxirides.historical_taxi_rides_raw`
WHERE
  trip_distance > 0
  AND fare_amount >= 2.5
  AND pickup_longitude > -75
  AND pickup_longitude < -73
  AND dropoff_longitude > -75
  AND dropoff_longitude < -73
  AND pickup_latitude > 40
  AND pickup_latitude < 42
  AND dropoff_latitude > 40
  AND dropoff_latitude < 42
  AND passenger_count > 0
  AND RAND() < 999999 / 1031673361
  
  ****************************Task 2: Create a BQML model called taxirides.fare_model____________________------------------
  
  
  CREATE or REPLACE MODEL
  taxirides.fare_model OPTIONS (model_type='linear_reg',
    labels=['fare_amount']) AS
WITH
  taxitrips AS (
  SELECT
    *,
    ST_Distance(ST_GeogPoint(pickuplon, pickuplat), ST_GeogPoint(dropofflon, dropofflat)) AS euclidean
  FROM
    `taxirides.taxi_training_data` )
  SELECT
    *
  FROM
    taxitrips
    
    
Click Run and the machine learning process will take about 2 minutes.

Evaluate model performance
After the training is completed, you can evaluate the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the prediction model using the following query.


#standardSQL
SELECT
  SQRT(mean_squared_error) AS rmse
FROM
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL taxirides.fare_model,
    (
    WITH
      taxitrips AS (
      SELECT
        *,
        ST_Distance(ST_GeogPoint(pickuplon, pickuplat), ST_GeogPoint(dropofflon, dropofflat)) AS euclidean
      FROM
        `taxirides.taxi_training_data` )
      SELECT
        *
      FROM
        taxitrips ))
              
 
 
 ---------------------------************Task 3: Perform a batch prediction on new data************************-----------------------------
 
 
 Select Set a destination table for query results under Destination; 
 Enter 2015_fare_amount_predictions as the Table name
 And For Destination table write preference ->Overwrite table
 
 Click Save
Run the following SQL query.

#standardSQL
SELECT
  *
FROM
  ML.PREDICT(MODEL `taxirides.fare_model`,
    (
    WITH
      taxitrips AS (
      SELECT
        *,
        ST_Distance(ST_GeogPoint(pickuplon, pickuplat)   , ST_GeogPoint(dropofflon, dropofflat)) AS    euclidean
      FROM
        `taxirides.report_prediction_data` )
    SELECT
      *
    FROM
      taxitrips ))
